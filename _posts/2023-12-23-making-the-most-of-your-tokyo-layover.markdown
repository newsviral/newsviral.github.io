### Visiting Tokyo on a LAYOVER
With some advance planning, it is absolutely possible to experience a glimpse of Tokyo even with just a layover at Haneda airport. However, the first step is ensuring you meet entry requirements to Japan. Most nationalities can enjoy a visa waiver for stays up to 90 days, but it's important to check your passport status. Upon arrival, proceed through immigration to officially enter the country for your layover activities. 
While 10 hours may not allow deep exploration of all Tokyo has to offer, with some strategic route planning you can enjoy a taste of this vibrant city. Be sure to allot sufficient time to pass through security for your onward flight. Public transportation like trains can get you into the center of Tokyo within an hour from Haneda.

Spend time wandering the expansive Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine or hiking up to the 11-meter tall Great Buddha at Kotoku-in Temple. For a calming interlude, relax in the moss garden at Kencho-ji Temple. Allot 4 hours minimum for Kamakura to properly experience its spiritual heritage.
