### Natural Wonders and Hidden Gems
Florida is home to some of the most remarkable natural landscapes in the United States. Beyond the tourist hotspots and crowded beaches lie vast expanses of unspoiled nature just waiting to be discovered. Mangrove swamps line the coast, sheltering countless species of wildlife. Crystal clear springs bubble up from the ground, some forming rivers that flow for miles. State parks have been established to protect these unique ecosystems and provide places for residents and visitors alike to enjoy nature. 
Journeying off the main highways especially along Florida's northern Gulf Coast rewards explorers with isolated stretches of softly swaying sawgrass, drifting clouds of blue heron overhead. Stop along any back road at sunset to witness Florida's stunning orange and pink skies reflected in calm waters. Explore uncrowded trails winding through ancient cypress trees draped with Spanish moss. With a little effort beyond the surface, Florida's natural beauty comes into full view.
