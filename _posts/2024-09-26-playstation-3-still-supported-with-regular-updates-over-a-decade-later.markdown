The legacy PlayStation 3 console continues receiving Sony's commitment to backwards compatibility and ongoing support despite being well over a decade old at this point. Regular firmware updates are released to keep the system and online services running smoothly. While some features have been phased out, the core functionality PlayStation fans loved about the PS3 lives on.
## Maintaining a Legacy Platform
**Sony continues optimizing PS3 system performance** after all these years with routine system updates. The latest firmware brings various minor improvements behind the scenes to ensure a seamless experience. These updates prove Sony's dedication to legacy platforms long after new hardware launches. Over 100 million PS3's were sold globally, showing just how many players are still using their original units over a decade later. 
###Accessing Online Features
In order to access PlayStation Network, online multiplayer, and store features, PS3 owners must keep their system software up to date. Sony makes this process straightforward with an **automatic firmware download and install option directly from the console's settings menu.** Users simply launch the update and wait for it to complete before signing back into PSN. This plug-and-play approach keeps the barrier to entry low for casual players.
## PS3 Multiplayer Lives On
A key appeal of the PS3 for many is its **robust online multiplayer ecosystem.** Thanks to Sony's longterm support, the core online functions gamers have come to rely on are still fully operational. Users can sign into PSN accounts and seamlessly jump into their favorite multiplayer shooters, sports titles, and cooperative games. No PlayStation Plus subscription is required either, making these experiences freely accessible for all.
### Popular Shooters See Ongoing Support   
Games like the mega-hit **Call of Duty: Black Ops** still boast an active multiplayer community over a decade after its 2010 release. Its gritty, tactical multiplayer modes have remained entertaining for hardcore fans. Likewise, fans of the cinematic **Max Payne 3** can still swap bullets in intense gunfights across urban environments today. The passionate communities behind these titles are a testament to their longstanding replay value.

## PlayStation Plus Perks Phase Out on PS3
While the core online services do not require a paid subscription, Sony began phasing out certain extra PlayStation Plus perks on the aging PS3 hardware in recent years. Back in 2013 when the PlayStation 4 launched, PlayStation Plus became the premium tier service it is today. However, the service originally provided different benefits depending on the platform.
### Free Monthly Games Come to an End
For many years, PlayStation Plus members on PS3 enjoyed the same **free game offerings each month** available on newer platforms. This included surprise indie hits and blockbuster classics to build your game library without spending extra. In March 2019, Sony announced it would no longer provide these free games to PS3 and PS Vita consoles going forward. Understandably, the third-party licensing renewals became too costly to maintain on older hardware generations longterm.
### PS Plus on Newer Hardware Offers More Value 
In contrast, PlayStation Plus subscribers enjoying the service benefits on PS4 and newer PlayStation platforms have access to a more extensive selection of monthly games, exclusive discounts, online multiplayer access, and cloud storage additions. It's clear Sony wants to leverage PlayStation Plus as a driver for consumers to upgrade to current-gen hardware for enhanced value.
## Legacy Consoles Offer More Welcoming Communities  
Despite the phased-out perks, some PlayStation fans continue happily using their PS3 systems even today for its affordability and more relaxed online atmosphere. In particular, players of massively popular online **games like Grand Theft Auto V** and **Red Dead Redemption** have touted the PS3 communities as less toxic than newer platforms. With no monthly fees required either, there's no barrier keeping casual fans engaged for the long haul.
### Nostalgia and Value Propel Legacy Hardware
The PS3 succeeded in building a devoted install base with its diverse library and online offerings available to all. Over a decade later, that legacy lives on thanks to the ongoing value proposition and nostalgia certain titles evoke. As long as passionate communities exist behind the games, Sony has incentive to maintain core functionality through system updates. The PS3 stands as a testament to building a platform focused on accessibility and lasting entertainment above all else.
## Conclusion
In closing, Sony deserves commendation for its multi-year support of the PlayStation 3 hardware and services. By maintaining regular system updates and core online functions even over a decade later, they honor the massive investment their user base made in PS3 games and accessories. While next-gen experiences offer more premium perks today, the PS3 remains a worthwhile platform for its affordability, robust catalog, and relaxed online atmospheres - proving that valued legacy systems can survive generations into the future. Gamers will always appreciate a company's commitment to maintaining platforms long after sales taper off.
