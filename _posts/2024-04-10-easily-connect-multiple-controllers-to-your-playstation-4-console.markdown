Connecting game controllers is essential for enjoying multiplayer gaming sessions on the PlayStation 4 (PS4). While the base PS4 comes with a single DualShock 4 controller, adding additional controllers allows for local competitive and cooperative play. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the various wired and wireless connection options for linking multiple controllers to your PS4 system.
### Single Controller Setup
The initial controller connection process is straightforward. First, power off both your PS4 console and DualShock 4 controller. Connect the controller to your PS4 using the provided USB charging cable. Press and hold the PS button located in the center of the controller until the lightbar embedded along the top illuminates. This indicates the controller has powered on and is attempting to sync with the console. 
Once paired, the lightbar will remain a solid color, usually blue, and you can disconnect the USB cable. **If the lightbar flashes intermittently or fails to connect at all, try a different USB cable or contact Sony support for troubleshooting assistance.** Most issues occur due to faulty or low-quality aftermarket cables that cannot reliably transmit data between the controller and console. Genuine Sony cables are recommended for initial and troubleshooting connections.

### Using Your TV Remote for Basic Navigation 
Many modern televisions can be used to perform basic navigation and media playback controls on the PS4 through a feature called **HDMI-CEC device linking**. To enable this, go to **Settings > Devices > Controllers > Enable HDMI Device Link** on your console. Selecting this option allows certain TV remotes that are HDMI-CEC compliant to control basic PS4 functions without requiring a DualShock controller, depending on your specific TV model.
### Bluetooth Pairing for Universal Remote Controls
If you have a universal remote that supports Bluetooth connectivity, it may be able to pair directly with your PS4 for wireless operation. Navigate to **Settings > Devices > Bluetooth Devices** and select "Add New Device" to initiate the pairing process. Follow the on-screen instructions to put your remote into discovery or pairing mode. Once found, the PS4 will request confirmation to link the remote. After authentication is complete, you should be able to use certain remote buttons to navigate menus and media just like a DualShock controller over Bluetooth.
### Remote Play on Mobile and PC
The powerful Remote Play feature allows using supported mobile devices, tablets, and Windows/Mac computers to view your PS4 screen and control games over your home Wi-Fi network or internet connection. To set this up, download the free PlayStation Remote Play app from the iOS App Store, Google Play Store, or PlayStation website. Launch the app and follow the prompts to pair with your PS4 by entering the given code. After linking, you can begin streaming and controlling your console remotely from another room or even outside your home network. 
Remote Play is ideal for **casual gameplay sessions when others are using the TV** or to continue a game on the go from your phone during a commute. Performance will vary depending on your network bandwidth and hardware but provides a compelling option for untethered PS4 control.
### Adding Guest Controllers 
Once the primary controller is configured, you can easily pair additional DualShock 4 pads for local multiplayer. With the connected controller, press and hold the PS button on the second controller while in close proximity to the PS4. The console will detect the incoming connection request. Select the option to add it as a "Guest Controller" rather than assigning it to a specific PSN profile. 
This bypasses the signup process and allows guests to instantly join multiplayer games each time that controller is used with your PS4. The guest pads function identically but can only access content you own and will not save game progress to the cloud. This provides a seamless way for friends and family to hop into split-screen sessions.
### Using Multiple Controllers Simultaneously 
When diving into local competitive or co-op PS4 titles that support **two-player couch multiplayer**, having additional controllers paired beforehand streamlines the experience. Launch a compatible game with two or more controllers connected. One player presses options on their controller first to sign in, while a second player then selects their character by pressing start on their pad. 
The PS4 recognizes both inputs simultaneously, enabling both controllers to be used together in split-screen or online multiplayer matches from the couch. Titles that employ this dual simultaneous controller support include classics like Rocket League, Borderlands, and many fighting games for memorable local head-to-head showdowns.
### Common Connection Troubleshooting Tips
Even with the straightforward pairing process, controller connection hiccups can still occasionally occur. The troubleshooting steps outlined earlier addressing cable quality should resolve most issues. Beyond that, here are some additional tips:
#### Clear Bluetooth Pairing Cache
Navigate to **Settings > Devices > Bluetooth Devices > Clear Pairing Cache** and delete any remnants of previous unsuccessful connections. This refreshes the system's device list.
#### Update Controller and Console Firmware 
Outdated firmware can cause glitches. Ensure both your DualShock and PS4 are running the latest updates from **Settings > System Software Update**.
#### Reset Controller to Factory Defaults
As a last resort, in **Settings > Devices > Controllers**, select your controller and choose "Reset Connection" to completely wipe pairing data and restore default Bluetooth settings. This may solve anomalous pairing rejections.
With these thorough connection guidance and troubleshooting solutions, you'll be equipped to easily configure and maintain multiple DualShock and compatible controllers on your PS4 for awesome local multiplayer gaming sessions for years to come. Let me know if any other PlayStation questions arise!
