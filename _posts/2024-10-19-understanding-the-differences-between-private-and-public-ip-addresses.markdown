## What Are Private and Public IP Addresses?
Private and public IP addresses serve different purposes on networks. **Private IP addresses** are used for internal device-to-device communication within a private local area network (LAN), such as a home or office network. **Public IP addresses** publicly identify devices on the internet. 
### Private IP Addresses For Internal Networks
Private IP addresses start with 10., 172.16-31., or 192.168. They are dynamically assigned by the **local area network (LAN) router** using the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to networked devices like computers, phones, smart devices, and more. Only one private IP address will be given to each device on the network to avoid address conflicts. Since private IP addresses are non-routable and only used internally, they can be reused across different networks without issues.

### Public IP Addresses For Internet Identification  
A public IP address is globally unique and publicly identifies each internet-connected device or network on the public internet. Internet service providers (ISPs) assign **public IP addresses** to customer networks and devices to allow communication and routing of data to and from the internet. Home networks are typically assigned just one public IP address that the home router uses for network address translation (NAT) to share its public internet connection amongst private addressed devices.
## How to Configure a Static Private IP Address
Routers can assign the same private IP address to a specific device based on its unique media access control (MAC) address each time it connects. This establishes a **static private IP address** through MAC address reservation in the router's settings. Alternatively, devices can manually set a static private IP in their own network configuration settings, but this risks address conflicts if another device is accidentally assigned the same static address.  
## Checking if a Private IP Address is Static or Dynamic
To determine if a private IP address is static or dynamically assigned, routers allow checking DHCP settings. If DHCP is enabled under wider area network (WAN) options, the router will dynamically assign private IP addresses. On Windows, using the Command Prompt and running "ipconfig /all" displays the output and indicates if DHCP is enabled. This confirms if the private IP address is static or dynamically assigned through DHCP.
## How to Request a Static Public IP Address from an ISP
While some ISPs assign static public IP addresses by default, others only provide dynamic public IP addresses that can periodically change. Check the ISP's website for static IP availability, or call customer support to ask about options and any additional monthly fees. In some countries and service areas, like in France where the author is located, their ISP provides static public IP addresses included with their home internet plan. This allows hosting servers and services externally from a residential connection.  
## Checking the Assigned Public IP Address 
Websites like whatismyip.com allow simply visiting to view the **currently assigned public IP address**. It's important to note this address could change periodically for connections with a dynamic public IP assignment from the ISP. Bookmarking or saving the IP displayed may only be accurate for that moment, as dynamic public IPs have no promised time frame of when the address may be updated to a new one.
## Benefits of Configuring a Static IP Address
Static IP addressing can be useful for applications that require persistent external access, like hosting a small home web server, file/printer sharing, or forwarding specific ports. A static IP ensures services and devices will always be reachable at the same consistent address, rather than possibly changing with a dynamic assignment. This is important for remote access to networks and continual functionality of internet-facing services.
## Factors Determining Static or Dynamic IP Assignment  
Several configuration factors together determine if an IP address, either private or public, will be statically assigned or dynamically change periodically. Router settings, ISP policies, and network configurations all play a role - no single element alone dictates the IP addressing method. Proper determination requires understanding a specific local network configuration and the ISP's capabilities and offerings.
## Summary
In summary, private IP addresses operate internally on private LAN networks, while public IP addresses serve as identifiers on the public internet. Methods for checking and obtaining static IP addressing were described, including configurations through routers and ISPs. However, the optimal IP addressing solution is unique to each network and dependent on available router, device, and ISP options. Proper setup integrates knowledge of these different influencing components.
