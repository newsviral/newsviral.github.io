## Why You Should Consider a Wired Ethernet Connection 
The Nintendo Switch is a versatile gaming console that can be played on the TV or handheld. However, many games require a strong and stable internet connection for online multiplayer and downloading large game/system updates. While Wi-Fi is convenient, an Ethernet cable connection provides faster speeds and better reliability compared to wireless. Here are some key reasons to consider setting up a wired connection on your Switch.
### **Increased Bandwidth and Throughput for Downloads and Gaming**
A wired Ethernet connection establishes a direct, dedicated link between your Switch and home router without any interference from other devices. This gives you full utilization of your internet speed. Most broadband connections support download speeds of 50 Mbps or higher, but Wi-Fi often struggles to reach those limits due to things like distance, obstructions, or congestion. An Ethernet cable effectively removes these limitations to deliver the best possible throughput for large downloads, game patches, and smooth online gaming.

### **More Stable and Reliable Network Performance** 
Wi-Fi signals can degrade or drop depending on signal strength, interference, or if the router gets overloaded by multiple devices streaming video simultaneously. By going wired, you eliminate these instability problems. An Ethernet connection is much less prone to lag spikes, disconnects, or any loss of connectivity compared to wireless. This results in a rock-solid internet experience whether you're playing online or downloading apps and games in the background.
### **Compatibility with Local Network Game Modes**
Many multiplayer games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe offer **"LAN Play"** modes that let multiple Switches connect directly over an internal network instead of playing online. This local wireless functionality requires an Ethernet connection between the consoles for setup. A wired link makes it easy to enjoy these unique network modes with friends in the same home.
## Wired Connection Options for the Switch
While the Switch itself lacks an Ethernet port, it can be connected to your home network using a USB to Ethernet adapter. There are a few options depending on your specific needs:
### **USB-C Adapter for Handheld Play** 
This type of adapter plugs directly into the USB-C port on the Switch console when undocked, allowing for a wired connection during portable gameplay. Be cautious as not all USB-C hubs are Switch compatible. Orico and Anker make reliably tested options.
### **USB-A Adapter for Docked Play**
For playing on the TV using the Switch dock, look for a small USB-A to Ethernet adapter that plugs into one of the USB ports built into the dock. This provides an easy wired solution without modifying the dock hardware.
### **Dual USB Adapter for Flexibility**
Nintendo's official HORI branded adapter is unique in offering both USB-C and USB-A connectors, letting you use a single adapter for either handheld or docked wired sessions. Its flexible design optimizes convenience.
By choosing the right USB Ethernet adapter, any Switch setup can experience the quality benefits of an Ethernet connection for gaming, downloads, and LAN play. 
## Setting Up a Wired Connection on Your Switch
Actually configuring the Ethernet on the Switch is simple once you have the proper USB adapter installed. Here are the basic steps both for portable and TV docked modes:
### **Handheld Wired Connection**
1. Plug your USB-C to Ethernet adapter into the Switch in handheld mode.
2. Go to System Settings > Internet > Internet Settings. 
3. Select "Change Settings" and then choose "Use Ethernet Cable". 
4. Your Switch should now detect the Ethernet connection and acquire an IP address from your home router automatically.
### **Docked Wired Connection** 
1. Plug your USB-A to Ethernet adapter into one of the USB ports on the Switch dock.
2. Dock your Switch console as normal for TV play. 
3. Navigate to the same Internet Settings menu in System Settings.
4. Choose "Use Ethernet Cable" and the Switch will connect over the wired link.
Setting up Ethernet is as simple as selecting the wired option in your Switch network settings. It's a seamless process whether playing handheld or on the big screen with the dock.
## Optimizing Your Wired Connection Speed 
Once connected via Ethernet, it's a good idea to benchmark the network performance improvement over Wi-Fi. The Speedest app is a popular free speed test available on the Nintendo eShop. Run a few tests to compare:
### **Measure Download/Upload Speeds**
See how much additional bandwidth an Ethernet cable unlocks for your home internet connection. Wired should noticeably increase both download and upload throughput. Downloads in particular tend to max out available speeds.
### **Test Connection Stability** 
Run tests when your home network is busiest to check for any instability or lag spikes over Wi-Fi. The wired ethernet connection should remain rock-solid even with multiple devices streaming simultaneously. 
### **Consider Your Router Placement**
If you see better but not great speeds on the test, try relocating your router closer to the Switch dock/play area. Shorter cable lengths maximize both speed and reliability of the physical connection.
With some targeted tests, you can fully optimize your Switch's wired connection for seamless downloading, smooth online play, and of course enjoying integrated LAN games with local friends. An Ethernet cable is well worth the investment.
## Popular LAN-Enabled Switch Games
Thanks to integrated **"LAN Play" functionality,** several Switch titles let multiple consoles directly connect over an internal network for competitive and cooperative local multiplayer without an internet connection. A wired ethernet setup unlocks these unique features:
### **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** 
Nintendo's flagship racing game is the poster child for LAN support on Switch. Up to 8 Switches can compete head-to-head **over customizable battle arenas and classic circuit races.** Holding LAN parties is a blast with this option.
### **Splatoon 2** 
Ink-splatting turf wars shine even brighter when played **against friends all battling on the same living room network.** Ethernet adapters make spontaneous local 4v4 matches very easy. 
### **ARMS** 
Stretchy fighting is just as compelling going **mano a mano in living color versus AI bots or other players sitting nearby**. LAN options enhance the thrill of the brawl.
As long as each Switch is plugged into the same local network via Ethernet adapters, many online-oriented titles unlock their co-op and competitive multiplayer right at home. LAN functionality invites great casual play anytime.
## Tips for Maintaining Your Wired Connection
Establishing a strong and stable internet connection with an Ethernet cable involves a few minor ongoing best practices:
### **Use High-Quality Cables**
Invest in durable, firmly-shielded **Cat6 Ethernet cables rated for Gigabit speeds** whenever possible. Higher quality cabling means better reliability and maximum throughput.
### **Keep Switches and Routers Updated** 
Always install the latest system software and firmware on your Switch console as well as your home Wi-Fi router. Recent updates frequently include stability and **security enhancements important for online gaming.**
### **Limit Wireless Interference**
Avoid situating your Switch dock near other **electronics that could introduce electromagnetic noise like cordless phones or baby monitors.** Keep it as far as possible from uncongested Wi-Fi networks too.
Adhering to simple suggestions maintains your fast, dependable wired connection for all your Switch online and LAN play into the future. With the right setup, an Ethernet cable is the best way to experience all the Switch internet has to offer without compromise.
