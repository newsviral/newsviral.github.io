### Background Changes Have Made Recovery More Difficult  
WeChat has grown to become one of the most widely used social messaging apps in China and around the world. However, in recent years the platform implemented changes that now require phone number verification for account registration and usage. This has presented challenges for those who previously used WeChat without a linked phone number. **While full recovery cannot be guaranteed, with persistence and detailed account records, regaining access to old accounts may still be possible.**

### The Initial Options for Account Creation  
In the past, WeChat users had more flexibility in how they set up and managed their accounts. Between 2011 to 2016, it was feasible to register without a phone number by only providing an email address. After an email was linked, the associated phone number could also be conveniently removed from the profile. This allowed people to use the same phone number to create multiple separate WeChat IDs over time.
### Mandatory Phone Verification Changes Everything
Starting in 2018, WeChat rolled out adjustments requiring all new user registrations and logins to be authenticated with a verified mobile phone number. Under the revised system, simply removing or changing the linked number was no longer an straightforward process. Any accounts missing a phone number tie-in would moreover be deleted. This posed challenges for recovering access to older profiles people had established without permanently connecting a number in the past.
### Trying to Modify the Linked Contact Information  
One avenue some individuals have pursued is attempting to modify the phone number linked to their original WeChat account. This involves reaching out to WeChat customer service through official support channels like email or an online form. Representatives may ask for detailed account registration information like the registration email, creation date, friend list details, and payment records to confirm ownership. If provided accurately, there is a possibility support can facilitate changing the number currently associated with the profile. However, success depends on how complete the verification information is.
### Directly Engaging WeChat Customer Care   
For those without newer contact details saved to the desired account, a direct option is contacting WeChat customer service and politely explaining the specific situation and history. Customer reps can be requested to investigate whether the inactive profile still exists within WeChat's user databases. It's important to clearly convey all known account particulars like the original registration email or phone number used before being locked out. While full account restoration cannot be assured, taking the time to fully communicate circumstances to care representatives presents another pathway for potential solutions. 
### Factors Impacting the Likelihood of Success
Naturally, the longer an account has remained inactive, the more difficulties may arise in convincing WeChat support of legitimate prior ownership. Company policies understandably favor protecting currently active users over restoring very outdated profiles. Technical limitations may also hinder recovery depending on how far account data has been purged from backend servers over time. Problems are further compounded without having recent contact or transactional details linked within the dormant account. Potential account holders should manage expectations and be prepared for possible denial of assistance.
### Supplemental Documentation Can Strengthen Cases
To strengthen cases for review, gathering any supplemental documentation remaining from the past WeChat usage can bolster claims of being the authentic account owner. Examples include old chat transcripts, contact lists, payment confirmations, profile screenshots and more. Assembling a complete picture through past account activity records demonstrates serious intent in the recovery request. While an imperfect process, assembling thorough supporting documentation maximizes the chances of regaining access under the new stringent requirements.  
### Persistence and Patience May Lead to Success  
Losing access to cherished WeChat profiles due to policy changes can understandably cause frustration. However, through consistently following up and providing all helpful identifying details, there is still hope. While a positive outcome is not fully guaranteed, exhausting available recovery options through WeChat support demonstrates commitment and allows investigating all possible resolutions. With diligence, selectivity and time and effort extended to the process, happier endings do occasionally result.
### Conclusion  
WeChat's 2018 mandatory phone verification brought inconveniences for some users. Regaining entrance to unpaid or long-dormant accounts presents unique challenges. This article outlined the key factors impacting chances of account restoration success through available avenues. With organized documentation, clear communication and dedication seen through, there is a possibility of once again interacting with cherished contacts and content on the popular Chinese social platform. While there are no guarantees, persistence and thorough preparation presents the optimal path.
