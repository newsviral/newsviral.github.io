### Vivid Experiences Through Colors
As an expert in colorizing black-and-white photos, I couldn't help but chuckle at the question about travel bags. Seriously, who has time to worry about travel bags when you can bring your cherished memories to life in vibrant colors? But travel bags have the power to instantly transport us back to our favorite memories just like colors can in photos.

### Bags That Take You on a Journey
In my experience, the best travel bags are the ones that can magically transport you back in time to relive your favorite moments. Imagine zipping open a bag and being instantly transported to that amazing vacation you took with your loved ones. Now that's a travel bag worth having! Who cares about durability, compartments, or fancy features when you can have a bag that brings back memories with a single touch?
### Seeking Practicality or Nostalgia?  
But hey, if you're looking for practical advice, I suppose there are some decent travel bag brands out there. Just make sure they have enough space to carry all your colorful memories, because trust me, those are the moments you'll truly want to hold on to. Happy travels!
### Rimowa - The Definition of Durability
I've tried them all--Tumi, Zero Halliburton, etc. and have reached the inevitable conclusion that RIMOWA is by far the best. Durable and flexible, lifetime warranty and light as a feather. The four wheel trolley is a dream. Runner up: Mandarina Duck "Work" line. But I'd trade all my gorgeous, heavy, and ridiculously expensive aluminum Halliburtons for two big Rimowa Salsas in black or silver in a heartbeat.
### Red Oxx Air Boss - Comfort and Space for Memories  
I'm a huge fan of my Red Oxx Air Boss, which is super sturdy (in terms of construction; its still a soft-sided bag), has a ton of space inside (more than big enough to hold a vacation's worth of clothes and suprisingly good at not wrinkling them), and easy to weave around pedestrian traffic in airports due to its lack of wheels/frame. The Red Oxx Air Boss offers exceptional durability and space for all your memories from vacations.
### Memorable Travels with Tumi
Tumi is a famous brand known for durable and high-quality **"lifetime luggage"**. While their hard-sided products like the Xenon come at a high price, they are truly built to last and back their products with an industry-leading warranty. The expanded zippered pockets and trolleys on Tumi bags make it easy to organize clothes and accessories. Tumi allows you to travel in style while protecting your cherished memories for years to come.
### Building Memories with Mandarina Duck
As a runner up to RIMOWA, Mandarina Duck's **"work bags"** provide style, versatility and toughness. Their water-resistant ballistic nylon and leather constructions stand up to daily wear and tear from business trips and vacations. Features like padded laptop compartments and accessory pockets mean your technology and travel essentials stay safe and organized. The quality craftsmanship of Mandarina Duck bags will help build memories for a lifetime.
### Travel Bags - Holding Onto What Matters Most  
Whether you prefer hard-sided ruggedness or soft-sided comfort, the best travel bags help you hold onto life's most meaningful moments. As colors do for photographs, the right bag can instantly transport you back to memories of people and places that matter most. So next time you shop for a travel bag, focus not just on features but how it will help you relive memories for years to come.
