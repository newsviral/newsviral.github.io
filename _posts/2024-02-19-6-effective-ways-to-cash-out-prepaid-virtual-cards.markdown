### Transfer to PayPal for Quick Access###
One quick method is transferring your card balance to your PayPal account. Simply log into PayPal and enter your virtual card details. PayPal charges a small fee, usually around $1-3, to send the funds instantly to your verified PayPal cash balance. From there, you have many convenient ways to access the money, such as transferring to your **linked bank account** for free or using your PayPal debit Mastercard wherever cards are accepted. This process often takes under an hour, allowing swift access to your funds. 
### Cash Out with a US Postal Money Order###
For those hoping to turn their virtual balance into physical cash, a postal money order provides an affordable route. Visit your local post office and purchase a money order up to $500 for around $1-2 per order. Simply sign the back and deposit or cash the money order like a personal check at your bank or post office. No hassle and usually accepted wherever checks are. Just remember to factor in transportation time to and from the post office when planning this method.
### PayPal Yourself for Quick Digital Access### 
Another easy PayPal-based option is sending funds to your own PayPal account using the virtual card. After logging into PayPal on your computer or app, navigate to “Pay or Send Money” and pay yourself the full card balance. PayPal charges a nominal fee, typically around $1-3, to complete the transfer which shows up in your PayPal cash balance almost immediately. From there, the funds can be spent online or transferred out for minimal or no fees. 
### Transfer to Digital Bank for Mobile Banking Perks###
Digital banks like Varo offer **convenient mobile banking features** perfect for redeeming virtual cards. Simply log into the bank app and transfer funds from the prepaid card to your linked debit card. Expect the transfer to complete within a few hours with no fees attached. The funds become available for immediate use via mobile deposits, peer-to-peer payments with friends, and free ATM access nationwide. Plus earn competitive interest on your daily balances. Leverage a digital bank account as the ideal single depository for virtual cards and daily spending needs.

When choosing how to cash out a prepaid card, take time to evaluate all options and their attached fees. Money orders offer cheap access to physical cash but require travel. PayPal provides excellent digital liquidity for a nominal percentage fee. And banking apps present fully-loaded checking functionality to spend or save electronically. Simply running the math on transfer costs versus ATM charges lets you pick the method extracting the highest dollar amount towards your financial priorities.
