## Part 1: A Closer Look at the Hardware Differences
The Nintendo Switch OLED model was released in October 2021 as an upgraded version of the original Switch system. While it features some notable enhancements, the core question remains - is the OLED screen worth upgrading for? Let's take a closer look at the hardware differences between the original Switch and the new OLED model.
### **Bigger, Brighter Display with Deeper Blacks**
One of the most noticeable differences is the larger 7-inch OLED screen on the new model compared to the original Switch's 6.2-inch LCD display. **OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) technology** provides a higher quality screen with richer colors and inky blacks. Text and in-game graphics really "pop" more on the OLED thanks to its self-emissive pixels and ability to turn off individual dark areas for true blacks. This makes a huge difference in handheld mode where you can appreciate the screen's improved quality.

### **Adjustable Stand and Better Audio** 
The OLED Switch also features an adjustable stand on the back, allowing you to change the viewing angles for tabletop play more freely. Rounding out the hardware upgrades is improved stereo speakers for better sound quality. While minor, these are nice quality-of-life upgrades over the original model.
### **Same Processor and Performance When Docked**
However, it's important to note that under the hood, the systems contain identical Nvidia Tegra processors. This means graphical performance and power remain identical whether you're playing in handheld or docked TV modes. For many players, this likely won't impact the gaming experience.
## Part 2: Personal Experience with Multiple Switch Models
Having owned multiple Switch models personally, I can offer some insights on how the upgrades impact real-world use. I initially purchased the original 2017 Switch at launch and later upgraded to the revised model with improved battery life. Most recently, I picked up the OLED version on day one.
### **OLED Screen Makes a Big Difference for Handheld Play** 
Its larger size and improved picture quality makes simply staring at the screen for extended handheld sessions more enjoyable. Text is sharper, colors truly pop more, and the lack of ugly borders around the image enhance immersion. The deeper blacks also help games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild really shine in portable mode.
### **Adjustable Stand and Improved Audio Are Nice Touches**
While relatively minor, the adjustable kickstand allows for more flexibility finding a comfortable angle regardless of where you play. Also, the improved speakers deliver richer audio than the original model without sounding tinny. Games with complex soundtracks now sound more full-bodied.
### **Screen Upgrade Doesn't Change Docked Experiences** 
However, when docked, I frankly can't notice a difference between models. Graphical performance remains unchanged as expected. So unless focusing primarily on handheld gameplay, the upgrade may not be worth it for heavy TV gamers.
## Part 3: Recommendations for First-Time Buyers
For anyone in the market for their very first Nintendo Switch, I would recommend the new OLED model without hesitation. The meaningful upgrades it offers, especially around the display, make it the best starting point. Let's dive deeper into why:
### **OLED Screen Enhances Portable Gaming**
Spending countless hours playing games on-the-go is a core part of the Switch experience. The OLED's significantly improved screen takes that aspect to the next level. Bright, vibrant colors and deep blacks make handheld titles truly shine.
### **Stand and Speakers Sweeten the Deal** 
Its adjustable stand provides versatile tabletop viewing, while richer audio makes games and cutscenes even more immersive. These extras are appreciated bonuses for a first-time owner.
### **Strong Value Given 5+ Year Console Life-Cycle**
With Nintendo promising the Switch family of systems will remain on shelves through 2023, there's no question an OLED model purchase will remain relevant for several years. Given how long owners typically keep consoles, the upfront investment seems very reasonable.
While the marginal upgrades may not justify an existing owner's purchase, **the OLED Nintendo Switch is undoubtedly the best choice for new players entering the Switch ecosystem**. Its enhanced experience in handheld mode makes a meaningful difference right out of the box.
## Part 4: Upgrading From an Existing Switch 
For current Switch owners, the calculus around upgrading to the OLED model requires more deliberation. After all, older Switch models remain perfectly capable machines and upgrades are not cheap. Let's examine some key considerations:
### **Handheld-Focused Players May find the Upgrade Worth It**
If you play exclusively or primarily in handheld mode, the OLED's dramatically improved screen alone could be justification enough. Truly seeing games in a new light makes a compelling case. 
### **Docked Gamers Won't Notice Much Difference**
However, for players who almost exclusively use their Switch docked to the TV, the enhanced experience is far more marginal. The processor and graphical output remain unchanged between models.
### **Most Owners are Better Off Waiting**  
Unless funds aren't an issue or you simply want the shiny new thing, it's difficult to say the upgrade is really "necessary" for existing players. Most will get more value continuing to enjoy their current Switch for now. 
While not a must-have for all, **certain handheld-focused Switch owners with disposable income may find worthwhile picture quality gains from upgrading to the OLED model**. But for docked-centric players, it's best to stay put unless your budget allows.
## Part 5: What's Included and Not Included 
Like past Switch models, neither the original nor the new OLED version include bundled games out of the box. Both systems come pre-loaded only with basic apps and Nintendo Switch software. So to actually play full games, separate game media must be purchased:
### **No Bundled Games Means Day-One Costs Add Up**
Whether opting for physical game cards or digital downloads, budget for additional game costs on top of the console's price tag. Starter Indie titles may only be $20-30 but bigger blockbusters can reach $60 each.
### **Built-In 32GB Storage Fills Up Fast** 
With just 32GB of internal storage, digital downloads will eventually overflow that space without an microSD memory card. Larger capacity cards of 64-256GB are recommended to avoid constant downloading/deleting.
### **Multiplayer Requires Online Subscription**
Nintendo Switch Online is required for online multiplayer in titles like Mario Kart, Smash Bros, Animal Crossing. A single year individual membership runs $20 but families can share for $35 annually. 
So while the Switch hardware itself provides the foundation, factoring in initial game and storage add-ons makes it an even more substantial investment. Doing research beforehand can help budget accordingly and get the most value possible right off the bat.
## Part 6: Does the OLED Model Offer More Power? 
When Nintendo first unveiled the Switch OLED model, some speculated enhanced internals could deliver boosted performance. However, upon its release details have shown identical specs under the hood. Let's address this topic directly:
### **Identical Nvidia Tegra Processor Means No Spec Bump**
Both the original Switch and the OLED variant run on the same Nvidia custom Tegra processor. This ensures complete compatibility between all Switch models.  
### **No CPU, RAM or Graphics Boosts in Handheld or Docked Modes**  
Gameplay, framerates and visuals remain precisely the same whether playing in portable or TV docked configurations. Titles run at their pre-existing specifications and resolutions.
### **OLED is a Screen Upgrade Only, Not a "Pro" Model** 
This was never positioned or intended to be a more powerful "Switch Pro." It's solely focused on refining the handheld experience through technical upgrades to the display. Internal grunt remains unchanged.
So in summary - while the **OLED screen delivers meaningful enhancements for gamers, it does not equate to any increase in raw horsepower under the hood**. Processing power stays identical across the Switch lineup. If wanting a specs boost, players will need to wait for an entirely new hardware generation.
## Part 7: Outlook on Future Switch Models
As the system approaches its 5-year anniversary in early 2022, speculation looms around what could come next for the Nintendo Switch platform. After establishing the OLED model enhances portability, what might we see down the road? Here are some thoughts:
### **Switch Lifecycle Still Has Legs Through 2023**  
Nintendo has reiterated support for the current Switch family through next year minimum. This suggests a true "pro" version remains a ways off yet. 
### **Powerhouse "Switch Pro" Unlikely at this Stage**
Releasing a significantly upgraded docked-only model this late wouldn't align with typical console cycles or develop a clear use case. 
### **True Next-Gen Switch Successor More Plausible Post-2023**
A future system taking advantage of newer mobile chipsets could deliver 4K visuals and other innovations while maintaining portable gameplay. This seems the likeliest "pro" level upgrade.
