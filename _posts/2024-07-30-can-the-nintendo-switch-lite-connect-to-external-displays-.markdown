## Introduction
The Nintendo Switch Lite was designed as a more affordable, handheld-only version of the original Nintendo Switch console. While portable and compact, many Switch Lite owners wonder if they can output the system's display to larger external monitors, laptops or desktop computer screens like the original Switch allows. Let's take a deeper look at the Switch Lite's connectivity options and see if connecting it to external displays is possible.
### The Switch Lite's Portable-Focused Design
Standing at only 3.6 inches tall and weighing around 0.61 pounds, the Nintendo Switch Lite was engineered from the ground up for handheld gameplay on its integrated 5.5-inch LED screen. Unlike its predecessor, Nintendo did not include docking station or HDMI output functionality, focusing purely on mobility.

## USB Connectivity and Charging
The Switch Lite features a USB Type-C port located on its bottom edge for **charging** and certain accessories. However, unlike the original Switch, this port does not support video output or connecting to external displays. 
### USB-C For Charging Only
When the Switch Lite is plugged into a computer or portable USB charger via its USB-C port, it will charge but will not output any video signal. The internal hardware and software are designed solely for internal display use through its integrated screen. USB-C acts only as a charging input, not an alternate video output like on the standard Switch.
## No HDMI Output From The Console
A key difference between the Switch Lite and original Switch models is the lack of HDMI port functionality on the handheld-only version. The standard Switch includes an HDMI port on its dock to output gameplay to  HDTVs and other **HDMI-compatible displays** when docked. However, the Switch Lite does not feature this port or the ability to output gameplay visually through an HDMI connection.
### Hardware Limitations Prevent HDMI Output 
Internally, the Switch Lite lacks the necessary processing hardware found in the Switch to output gameplay through HDMI. Its SoC (system on a chip) is optimized for running games solely on its integrated screen with no provisions made for external display capabilities. This inherent hardware limitation means HDMI output is simply not possible.
## Capturing Gameplay For Streaming Not Supported
Some Switch owners use capture cards that plug into the console's HDMI out port to record or stream gameplay real-time to computers. However, the Switch Lite does not support these types of solutions either due to lacking HDMI out functionality. 
### Strictly Internal Display Use
The Switch Lite hardware and software are designed strictly for running games and apps directly on its built-in screen. There is no way for a capture card or other accessory to access the Switch Lite's display signal externally like it can on the original Switch when docked. Streaming and capturing gameplay from the Switch Lite directly is not possible.
## Handheld Mode Is The Only Option
For the Switch Lite, players have no choice other than using its integrated 5.5-inch LCD screen for all gameplay. While superb for truly mobile on-the-go gaming, this means users cannot output games to a larger TV, computer monitor, or other external display.
### Screen Size Limitations
Being restricted to the Switch Lite's built-in screen results in it not being able to take full advantage of bigger displays the way the docked Switch can. Games appear smaller and less immersive compared to playing on larger **HDTV** or computer monitors some users prefer.
## Future Workarounds May Emerge With Time
Since the Switch Lite only recently launched, enthusiasts are still exploring possibilities for hacking or modifying the system. However, its internal design packed into a very compact handheld body makes extensive hardware changes quite challenging.
### Firmware Updates Could Potentially Enable New Features
Looking ahead, Nintendo may opt to add new functionalities to the Switch Lite via future firmware updates. For example, enabling a "docked mode" of sorts where USB-C mirrors the screen to a USB display dongle. However, Nintendo has not announced plans for any such updates currently. 
## For On-The-Go Gaming Only
Unless unforeseen workarounds emerge down the line, all signs point to the Switch Lite remaining a dedicated handheld gaming device only capable of running games and apps on its internal display. Those seeking big screen, home console-like capabilities will need to choose the full-sized Nintendo Switch model instead for maximum connectivity and display options. While more limited than its predecessor in display use, the Switch Lite delivers an exceptional fully portable Nintendo experience.
## Conclusion
Due to its stripped-down portable-focused design devoid of HDMI output support or internal hardware for mirroring its screen externally, the Nintendo Switch Lite can only display games and media through its integrated LCD. Workarounds attempting to output gameplay are simply not possible with the console in its current form. Therefore, the Switch Lite remains strictly a dedicated handheld gaming device meant for on-the-go fun, without the flexibility to output visuals to larger external displays that the original Switch allows when docked. While screen size is limited to its internal panel, the Switch Lite delivers truly untethered Nintendo experiences anywhere players desire.
