Digital games have become one of the most popular forms of entertainment over the past decade. As gaming has gone mainstream, the market for buying and selling used digital games has emerged. However, many people remain unaware of the potential risks involved when purchasing access to other people's game libraries or accounts from third parties. This article aims to provide an unfiltered look at the realities behind such transactions while offering safer alternatives for those seeking to buy games without their own account.
## Why Sharing Access to Your Account is Discouraged   
Selling or sharing access to your personal gaming account is generally **frowned upon by console makers** for several key reasons. First and foremost, it violates the terms of service agreed upon when creating your account with services like **PlayStation Network**. Companies like Sony implement these rules to maintain security and prevent fraudulent activity on their networks. 
### Sharing Your Login Credentials is Risky
Allowing others to use your account login credentials opens you up to the risk of your original information being changed without your consent. There have been many documented cases of individuals regaining access to accounts they previously shared or sold, only to change the login email and password, effectively locking out the new users. With direct access to payment methods and personal details, disgruntled former owners could cause financial or legal problems if so inclined.

### Accounts Can Get Reported and Banned
Another major concern is that popular reselling accounts sometimes get reported by disgruntled buyers if access is later lost. This increased scrutiny raises the chance of the account being investigated and potentially **permanently banned by Sony** depending on the details of the transaction. Once banned, any digitally purchased games tied to that account would no longer be accessible.
## Game Sharing is Different than Selling Full Access
While outright selling access to personal accounts is strongly discouraged, most platforms including PlayStation do silently tolerate reasonable forms of digital game **sharing amongst family members**. The key distinction is intent - gaming companies aim to prevent commercialization and profiteering rather than cooperatively sharing purchases within a legitimate household. 
### Sharing Within Families is Generally Ignored 
By setting each other's systems as the primary console, it is possible for up to two PlayStation accounts to access games, saves, and subscriptions purchased digitally by either user. Sony turns a blind eye to responsible cases that appear to function like a physical game library shared at home rather than an online business reselling account logins.
### Selling Carries Intents of Theft Under TOS 
Implied intent to profit rather than casual shared use of legitimately obtained games crosses Sony's threshold into activity they define as theft of intellectual property in their terms of service. Commercializing others' accounts challenges their revenue model more directly than informal sharing within domestic bounds.
## One Person's Account Hopping Experience  
To gain insight beyond speculation, I spoke to a user going by the name 'Thomas' about his 4 years of experience buying games through third-party resellers including Buygames.ps. According to Thomas, the process usually involved:
### Minimal Account Credentials Were Provided
Accounts typically contained only the purchased digital games with no linked payment methods or personal information beyond a randomly generated username and address. 
### Generic Login Details Avoided Detection 
By avoiding reused usernames, email addresses, or payment details, the voluntarily disposable accounts Thomas accessed were less likely to trigger fraud investigations from Sony.
### Partial Access Loss Was Inevitable  
Over the 7 total accounts purchased across different sites, Thomas estimated around 3 games disappeared or became inaccessible due to password resets beyond his control. Buygames.ps claims to issue new logins if this occurs.
## Questions Remain About Sellers' Business Practices
While services like Buygames.ps offer noticeable discounts on digital game codes, the legitimate origins and profit margins of these deals remain hazy. A few uncertainties around how such resellers operate include:
### Are Games Obtained Through Legal or Questionable Means?
Without visibility into supplier relationships, it's impossible to verify games are sourced appropriately rather than through theft, cracking, or other unlawful activities. Discounts of 40-60% raise eyebrows.
### What Are True Overhead and Profit Margins?  
Limited accounting transparency leaves purchase costs, storage/distribution fees, and final take-home percentages ambiguous. Such variables would shape the analysis of commercial intent. 
Without open book practices, outsiders can only speculate how these entities acquire and resell games while undercutting major storefront prices by wide margins long-term. The shroud of secrecy surrounding financial operations breeds doubt.
## Safer Alternatives Exist for Friends Wanting to Gift Games
For PlayStation users seeking low-risk methods of sharing games with friends and family, some better established options exist without the account vulnerability concerns:
### Gift PSN Credit Instead of full Account Access
Buying PlayStation Store gift cards allows recipients to purchase their own desired titles from Sony's online marketplace without involving any third party resellers or shared logins.
### Purchase Download Codes from Authorized Retailers  
Many major stores sell discounted PlayStation Network or Xbox currency/game codes redeemable by the buyer without requiring ongoing access to another's account. 
### Take Advantage of Shared Library Benefits Within a Household
For those living together, designating each other's consoles as a "primary" system enables up to two users per account to install and play games purchased digitally by either person.
By utilizing official gifting mechanisms respecting platform-holders' terms rather than profit-driven third parties, gaming fans can avoid the potential security and policy risks but still find affordable ways to spread the fun together.
## Additional Downsides of Buying from Resellers Remain 
A few final caveats exist for those still considering dealing with resellers rather than Sony or major retailers:
### No Recourse if Access Suddenly Ends  
With no contractual relationship, disgruntled buyers have no guarantees or ability to dispute account bans or password changes leaving them game-less.
### True Origins Usually Stay Hidden
Without full transparency into supply chains, repackaged access could still come from illicitly acquired codes, exploited regional pricing gaps, or other legally dubious behaviors. 
### Instant Removal Remains a Distinct Possibility
Since accounts technically belong to a separate individual, there exists an inherent potential for games tied to that profile to vanish at any moment without notice or explanation for almost any reason.
## In Summary - Play It Safe 
All things considered, the most secure approach for legitimate PlayStation fans remains dealing directly through official Sony avenues when possible. While game sharing amongst trusted household members faces leniency, outright commercializing or profiting from others' accounts will probably remain off-limits per the terms all users agree to. 
Safer options also exist for gift-giving through authorized retailer codes or PSN credits without requiring ongoing access tied to a separate person's profile. With security, policy adherence, and guarantors of continued access in mind - stick to the tried and true storefront whenever feasible for digital downloads. Profiteers always carry inherent uncertainties not present through proper channels. Let the games play on while playing it safe.
