### Understanding Wireless Mode 
Original Xbox 360 wireless controllers communicated with the Xbox 360 console via **radio frequency signals** rather than a wired USB connection. These controllers require**AA or AAA batteries** to power their internal wireless radio and circuitry. 
Wireless mode allowed for untethered **couch co-op** gaming sessions without messy wires getting in the way. However, the lack of a hardwired connection could result in occasional **signal interference or lag** if too many wireless devices were operating nearby.

### The Charging Port Explained
Located on the back of original Xbox 360 wireless controllers is a small plastic port designed to accommodate a **mini-USB charging cable**. This cable connects to a USB power source like a computer or wall adapter to deliver electricity into the controller. 
However, the cable that ships with controllers contains only two wires for **delivering charging current**, not the four wires needed to transmit data over USB. Its sole purpose is to **recharge internal rechargeable batteries** rather than enable a wired gameplay mode. This causes confusion for many users.
### Understanding the Difference Between USB Cable Types
USB cables come in two main varieties - **charging-only** and **data transfer** cables. Charging cables contain just the red and black power wires to push current one way. 
Data cables contain four separate copper strands corresponding to the USB standard - two for power delivery and two for bi-directional **high-speed data communication**. Without the proper data wiring, a device cannot establish a USB connection for inputs.
### Why Original Xbox 360 Controllers Only Work Wirelessly
Though the mini-USB port seems to suggest a wired option, original Xbox 360 wireless controllers were intentionally designed for **wireless-only use**. plugging the charging cable into a PC or even the Xbox itself will only charge batteries within the controller.
It will not allow for direct **USB passthrough control** since the cable lacks the correct data wires. Newer generation controllers from Microsoft like Xbox One pads added support for a wired mode over USB, but the original design mandated wireless functionality exclusively.
### Attempting a USB Connection 
If an original Xbox 360 wireless controller is plugged into any device, like a Windows PC, via its charging cable, it will not properly function as a wired input. The PC may even fail to detect a connected controller at all due to the lack of USB data signaling.
At best, the batteries inside will charge slowly over time but the controller itself cannot be used for direct **USB gamepad input**. It must communicate with the console via its internal **2.4GHz wireless radio chipset**. A wired connection mode was never implemented or intended.
### New Controllers Support USB Connectivity
Controllers released for newer consoles from Microsoft including Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and even recent Xbox 360 peripherals added the ability to bypass wireless and utilize a direct USB connection when plugged in. 
These pads contain all necessary wiring to establish high-speed USB 2.0 or 3.0 links with PCs and consoles. But the original Xbox 360 wireless controllers which helped launch the system in 2005 remain forever tied to short-range wireless communication exclusively.
### In Summary
To recap, original Xbox 360 wireless controllers operated through **radio signals** rather than wired USB like their successors. The charging port found on these first-generation pads serves only to replenish internal batteries with power. 
It does not facilitate true USB connectivity due to its simplified, charging-only cable design. This explains why they cannot be used as a **wired gamepad input** despite appearing USB-compatible at first glance. later controllers added versatile support for both modes.
