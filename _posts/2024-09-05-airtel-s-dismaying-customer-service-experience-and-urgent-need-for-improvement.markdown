Airtel, India's leading telecom provider that serves millions of subscribers nationwide, is facing serious customer dissatisfaction due to ongoing problems with their abysmal customer support infrastructure and services. While Airtel has the largest network coverage in India, their post-sales support is simply not meeting the expectations of today's digital customers. 
### Ways Airtel Customers Try to Reach Out for Help
Airtel advertises dedicated care numbers like 121 and 198 that customers can call from their Airtel number for assistance. **However, customers often report wait times of 30 minutes or more before even reaching an agent.** Some savvy users have tried contacting Airtel through their more responsive social media platforms such as **Facebook and Twitter.** Although social media allows you to publicly post your issue, the resolution process can take an unpredictable amount of time as well. 
For basic account information lookup, customers are instructed to dial *121*3*4

# which presents your mobile number. But this is of little help when actual problems arise that demand a live conversation. Overall, Airtel's contact options appear designed more for visibility than actual swift resolution of issues.
### Endless Runarounds Leave Customers Frustrated  
Once a customer manages to work through the lengthy automated systems on Airtel's phone lines, they commonly report being bounced between departments. Even a basic SMS query with "PORT 1900" to check mobile number portability met with uncertainty if it truly connects one to the right team. Days of attempts via different channels resulted only in constant redirects between the company's app and call centers - neither of which could fully solve issues on their own. 
### No Actual Agents to Speak With
After exhausting all the convoluted contact routes, customers complain there seem to be no real live agents available at all through conventional phone or app support. All methods led only to unending loops between automated systems, social media bots, and app redirections without human intervention. Complex problems simply cannot be solved through these shallow digital interactions alone.
### Urgent Need for Airtel to Revamp Their Dilapidated Support Infrastructure
In today's competitive world where **brands are just a click away from being abandoned,** customers want fast remedies for issues, not mazes of endless transfers and waits. Airtel must staff their phone lines with sufficient trained representatives who can handle problems **same-day** to meet basic service expectations. A direct priority support channel separate from the app is also critical for urgent matters that demand live agent assistance. Publishing realistic wait time estimates and resolution commitments would provide desperately needed transparency as well. 
### Eroding Loyalty and Trust Due to Poor Customer Service
When simple concerns fall into a black hole of negligence time after time, it severely damages customer satisfaction and retention in the long run. Even minor hassles become intense irritants without timely remedies. As a result, dissatisfied users actively seek out more responsive providers who can better address their post-purchase needs. If left unaddressed, Airtel risks long-term brand damage and losing loyal subscribers to more user-friendly competitors.  
### Urgent Recommendations for Turning Things Around
To begin rebuilding trust, Airtel must take dramatic steps to overhaul their underperforming support structure. First and foremost, they need to hire many more trained agents and reduce maximum wait times on call centers to under 5 minutes. Implementing 24/7 live chat and messaging channels would provide the flexibility of support through customers' preferred modes of contact. Service level agreements with committed resolution timeframes also need publishing to instill confidence. Most importantly, empowering frontline representatives to independently solve common problems without endless pass-offs is key to satisfaction. Conducting regular brand audits and holding accountability for poor customer experiences would help ensure continuous improvement. 
### Conclusion
While signups and sales may bring users in the door, it is the post-purchase experience that truly differentiates brands and decides customer loyalty over the long haul. As one of India's largest carriers, Airtel's deplorable support services do not cut it and require a ground-up transformation. Only by making customer satisfaction the top priority through industry-leading service and responsiveness standards can Airtel hope to regain credibility and seal in subscribers for the future. Their reputation and market position hang in the balance until comprehensive reforms are adopted.
