Writers and marketers often ask themselves how they can create long-form pieces of content that appeal to search engines and rank high in search results. While there is no single secret formula, focusing on readability, relevance, and optimization techniques can help content perform better online. This article will break down the process into several parts.
### Optimize for **Reader Experience** 
The first priority of any piece of content should be readability and usability for human readers. Search engines are still mainly focused on prioritizing content that users will find most helpful and engaging. Write in a natural, conversational style using varied sentence structures and an appropriate reading level for your target audience. Include relevant headings, subheadings, images, and other formatting to help guide readers through the content. Focus on providing genuine value rather than overt promotional messaging. Well-written, reader-focused articles are more likely to garner social shares, backlinks, and ultimately higher search rankings.

### Conduct Competitive Research
It's important to understand what types of content already exist on your topic and how successful competitors are approaching it. Analyze the top-ranking articles, blogs, and websites to identify common patterns in content structure, keyword usage, linking strategies, and more. Look at topics, structures, and formats that seem to be working well for others. Also identify any gaps where there may be opportunities to create unique, educational content that fills an unmet need for users. Careful research can help you craft smarter strategies that have a higher chance of success. 
### Choose Topics with High Search Volume 
The topic you select will play a major role in how discoverable your content can become. Opt for subjects that have enough consistent search traffic to sustain regular readers and backlinks over time. Use keyword research tools to find related longtail phrases and topics popular in your industry with hundreds or thousands of monthly searches. General, evergreen topics tend to rank better than narrow or transient ones. Make sure the scope is narrow and defined enough to comprehensively cover in a long-form piece while also remaining appealingly broad.
### Utilize an **Informative Structure**
Breaking content into well-defined sections and subsections creates a natural flow for readers and also signals topic focus to search engines. Use headings like "Introduction," "Background," "Applications," "Best Practices," and "Conclusion" to logically categorize information. Each part should stand independently while advancing the overall discussion. Vary in length - some sections can be shorter while others deserve more depth. Introduce subheadings beginning with terms related to your **primary keyword** and **topic keywords** for improved internal linking and readability.
### Optimize Internal Linking 
In addition to external links from other high-quality sites, internal linking refers to strategically placed cross-links within your own long-form content. This helps search engines assess topic relevance and importance. Wherever relevant, include internal links from subheadings and other distinguishable text back to previous sections for a more cohesive reader experience. Linking anchor text should contain targeted keywords when possible without being unnatural or repetitive. Test different linking structures to see which performs best.
### Promote Readability with **Graphical Elements**
Graphs, charts, images, videos, and other visual components break up dense blocks of text and engage readers on a more intuitive level. They also signal better readability and usability to search engines. Include relevant illustrations, screenshots, and infographics where helpful to simplify complex topics or drive concepts home. Proper attribution is important aswell. Visuals don't need to be elaborate - sometimes a simple bullet list, table, or diagram can suffice. Test different placements of visuals and analyze performance.
### Leverage External Link-Building Strategies 
While internal linking is important, external links from authoritative sites in your industry carry the most ranking weight. Identify types of sites like industry blogs, publications, and directories where your long-form piece could be referenced as a helpful resource. Develop link bait content like backlink-worthy infographics, ebooks, etc. Guest post on relevant blogs and forums mentioning your in-depth article. Social sharing is also a form of natural link-building when other bloggers engage with and spread your content organically. Be diligently helpful to build trusted relationships over time. 
### Optimize for Mobile with Responsive Design
As more search traffic comes from mobile devices, it's crucial to ensure content displays cleanly on any screen size. Use responsive design frameworks, relative units like ems instead of pixels for font sizing, and media queries for breakpoints. Test rendering and functionality across desktop and mobile browsers. Some optimization tips include condensing sidebars on small screens, lazy loading large images below the fold, and optimizing page speeds. If possible A/B test mobilized vs. non-mobilized versions. Publishers focused on creating excellent mobile experiences will see search and usage advantages over those that neglect responsiveness.
### Add Calls-to-Action and Conversions
Informative, educational content alone may not be enough to generate real business results. Include gentle calls-to-action wherever relevant throughout long-form articles to point readers towards desired conversions without being overbearing. For example, prompting readers to download a related resource, visit an associated product page, or sign up for an email list. Tests different CTA placements such as near the top, in internal links, or at the bottom. Track related metrics like form submissions or page views to optimize. The goal should be providing value first while guiding interested readers to next steps.
### Continuously Analyze Performance  
Publish your long-form content and begin tracking key performance indicators across search engines, social platforms, and your website. Tools like Google Search Console, Analytics, and keyword trackers can help identify what's working well and where improvements could be made. Analyze traffic sources, dwell time, exit rates, and conversion data. Continuously refine headlines, descriptions, and internal text based on user behavior signals. Be willing to test new optimizations regularly even on pages performing reasonably well already. The landscape is always shifting - content requires ongoing nurturing to sustain relevance over the long haul.
In summary, focus on readability, research, strategic formatting, thoughtful linking, and analytical testing to create long-form content pieces that meet user needs while ranking high in search engines. Prioritize value, structure topics logically, and be diligent about continual optimization to achieve the best results.
